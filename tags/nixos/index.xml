      <title>Blogging with orgmode, hugo and nix</title>

      <description>How I yet again decided to set up another iteration of this blog. This time using nix, hugo and of course orgmode..
Introduction This is my third attempt of setting up an easy to use blogging workflow. The first time I chose to try out use ox-hugo as well as github pages. Initially everything worked, but I quickly stopped writing posts because my initial setup using a single orgmode file with ox-hugo did not match my notetaking workflow, where I basically generate a bunch of random files and some of them get reworked or updated enough for me to think about publishing them.</description>

      <title>NixOS encrypted VM installation</title>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe how to set up a sparse VM image with full disk encryption and NixOS on ZFS, which can be uploaded to a VPS provider and then unlocked on boot using ssh.
First we need to create a virtual machine image file. Initially I tried using qemu-img, but somehow the image file was missing some information and the VM would not recognize a disk. Instead I went with the easy way and used virt-manager to create a new VM with the correct image size.</description>

      <title>NixOS on ZFS Install Script</title>

      <description>This is a rather short post and the start of what will hopefully become a nice little series of posts related to NixOS.
I just had to bulk install NixOS on a bunch of Intel NUCs, here is a little script to automate the installation process. Some bits and pieces are taken from other installation scripts, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know who to credit for them, I&amp;rsquo;m fairly sure this wonderful post from the NixOS discourse was involved though.</description>
