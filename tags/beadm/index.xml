      <description>This post introduces a fork of the FreeBSD beadm utility which can be used to manage Boot Environments on Proxmox ZFS Installations.
In this Post I will showcase how to use the beadm Boot Environment manager in Proxmox. After the showcase there are some notes on what I did to make beadm run on Linux in general and finally a part about what has been changed in order to make beadm work with Proxmox specifically.</description>
