      <description>How I yet again decided to set up another iteration of this blog. This time using nix, hugo and of course orgmode..
Introduction This is my third attempt of setting up an easy to use blogging workflow. The first time I chose to try out use ox-hugo as well as github pages. Initially everything worked, but I quickly stopped writing posts because my initial setup using a single orgmode file with ox-hugo did not match my notetaking workflow, where I basically generate a bunch of random files and some of them get reworked or updated enough for me to think about publishing them.</description>
