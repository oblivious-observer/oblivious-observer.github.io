      <title>NixOS encrypted VM installation</title>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe how to set up a sparse VM image with full disk encryption and NixOS on ZFS, which can be uploaded to a VPS provider and then unlocked on boot using ssh.
First we need to create a virtual machine image file. Initially I tried using qemu-img, but somehow the image file was missing some information and the VM would not recognize a disk. Instead I went with the easy way and used virt-manager to create a new VM with the correct image size.</description>

      <title>NixOS on ZFS Install Script</title>

      <description>This is a rather short post and the start of what will hopefully become a nice little series of posts related to NixOS.
I just had to bulk install NixOS on a bunch of Intel NUCs, here is a little script to automate the installation process. Some bits and pieces are taken from other installation scripts, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know who to credit for them, I&amp;rsquo;m fairly sure this wonderful post from the NixOS discourse was involved though.</description>

      <title>Introducing a Boot Environment Manager for Proxmox</title>
      <link>https://oblivious.observer/posts/proxmoxve6-boot-environment-manager/</link>

      <description>This post introduces a fork of the FreeBSD beadm utility which can be used to manage Boot Environments on Proxmox ZFS Installations.
In this Post I will showcase how to use the beadm Boot Environment manager in Proxmox. After the showcase there are some notes on what I did to make beadm run on Linux in general and finally a part about what has been changed in order to make beadm work with Proxmox specifically.</description>

      <title>Proof of Concept: Adding Boot Environments to Proxmox VE 6</title>
      <link>https://oblivious.observer/posts/poc-boot-environments-proxmoxve6/</link>

      <description>Dear Reader, this time I would like to invite you onto a small journey: To boldly go where no man has gone before (Alright, that&amp;rsquo;s not true, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s the first time someone documents this kind of thing in the context of Proxmox). We&amp;rsquo;re about to embark on a journey to make your Proxmox host quite literally immortal. Also since what we are essentially doing here is only a Proof of concept, you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use it in production, but as it&amp;rsquo;s really amazing, so you might want to try it out in a test environment.</description>

      <title>Encrypting Proxmox VE 6: ZFS, LUKS, systemd-boot and Dropbear</title>
      <link>https://oblivious.observer/posts/proxmoxve6-zfs-luks-systemdboot-dropbear/</link>

      <description>This describes how to set up a fully encrypted Proxmox VE 6 host with ZFS root and unlocking it remotely using the dropbear ssh server. Also it describes how you can do that, while keeping systemd-boot and thus also the pve tooling intact. (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the pve tooling still works if you replace systemd-boot with grub, which seems to be the common solution to creating this kind of setup, maybe it does.</description>
