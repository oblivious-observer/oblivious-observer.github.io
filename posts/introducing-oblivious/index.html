While ox-hugo definitely does it’s job I ended up spending quite a big amount of time with\n theming the whole thing, being annoyed with the go templating language, using the wrong version of hugo generally trying to figure out how to use ox-hugo manually downloading Javascript and CSS files so I could serve them locally  While both hugo as well as ox-hugo are really nice projects, using it I found myself thinking about how nice it would be to have a native way to create a static site directly from within Emacs.\nThere are actually quite a bunch of options when it comes to creating websites using Emacs and org-mode, I’ve tried some of them out and finally settled with the built-in org-publish, which is what I’m using now.\nBut you’ve just said you’ve written your own static site generator!\nWell yes, but actually no. I lied, kind of.. but maybe just bear with me for a while, it’ll make sense eventually.\nI haven’t written a static site generator, that would have been a really bad idea, after all I’m an utter illiterate when it comes to web development and up until this point I’ve basically just cargo culted my way through all of the web-development parts of creating this website. I’ve used org-publish in order to generate everything, because it’s a nice little built-in and basically just works out of the box.\nSo what is oblivious then?\nBasically oblivious is a small little command line application you can use to [automatically] create a website.\nEmacs and org-publish still do the heavy lifting, when it comes to the actual export of your org-files. oblivious takes care of a few other quality of life things, such as:\n injecting your org-publish configuration into your Emacs configuration, which is an utterly bad and gruesome idea in general, but it was kind of cool to simply “infect” my own config instead of having to take care of it elsewhere (you can actually use whatever export backend you prefer with oblivious) housekeeping tasks: such as configuring the .gitignore file or setting up the git user fetching (even building) external resources, such as Javascript or CSS triggering emacs in batch mode in order to load or tangle the configuration of a website  All of the configuration of a site resides in a single org file, which is then tangled and/or loaded into everything necessary to create a site.\nInside of the configuration file you define settings such as the value for #+author, ways to automatically fetch resources you need and templates for parts of the site.\nWhenever you change the configuration file, you run oblivious sync in order to generate all the templates etc and oblivious fetch, whenever you need to download resources. Using oblivious build you can then start a batch export, which creates your static site.\nHow exactly you set up your site is still pretty much up to you, but IHMO using oblivious basically provides you with a similiar interface to what you may know from using some of the more common static site generators, while at the same time being org-mode, emacs-lisp and bash under the hood.\nIf you’re intrigued and want to look at the gory details, I suggest you head over to the oblivious repo and look at the readme.org file, which is where I keep a detailed configuration of how this site was built at that time.\nOh and also hello world!\n","wordCount":"814","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-08-22T00:00:00+02:00","dateModified":"2020-08-22T00:00:00+02:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"oblivious observer"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://oblivious.observer/posts/introducing-oblivious/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"oblivious observer","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://oblivious.observer/observer-16x16.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme: #1d1e20;--entry: #2e2e33;--primary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg: #2e2e33;--code-bg: #37383e;--border: #333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://oblivious.observer accesskey=h title="(Alt + H)"><img src=/observer-64x64.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35></a>
